It came to me that time was suspect!
R. S. Shankland, “Conversations with Albert Einstein”
American Journal of Physics 31 (1963): 47–57.

That no inherent meaning can be assigned to the simultaneity of distant
events is the single most important lesson to be learned from relativity,
and it is an unavoidable component of any introduction to the subject.

It’s not just that
“Alice” and “Bob” aremuchmore pleasant to talk about than “Frame [of
reference] A” and “Frame B.” The fact that each of them comes equipped
with a distinct set of pronouns—at least in European languages—makes
some otherwise quite cumbersome narratives entirely colloquial and informal,
without sacrificing any precision.

ch 1 The Principle of Relativity

In 1905, however,
there was considerable confusion over whether the principle was applicable
to electromagnetic phenomena.

ch 4 COMBINING (ANY) VELOCITIES

(We shall consider only the case in which the ball
goes slower than the photon. Later we will see that there is something
highly problematic about balls that move faster than light.)

But this requires knowing whether two clocks in
different places are synchronized—precisely the issue we wished to avoid.
There is an easy way around this problem. Rather than end the race
when the photon reaches the finish line, we arrange for it to hit a mirror
and bounce back the way it came. We end the race only when the photon
reencounters the ball, which is still moving in its original direction.
